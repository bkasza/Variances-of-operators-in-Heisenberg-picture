# Variances-of-operators-in-Heisenberg-picture

This is draft of code evaluating expectations values of operators using Heisenberg picture up to 3 Hilbert subspaces originally referring to Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Tried out and error-check in case of using koherent and vacuum states. There still may accure errors using number states and superposition states. Evolution is given by simply writing step by step evolution of operators in Heisenberg picture. Because I didn't use any pre made libraries to speed up this code some evaluations can take longer time. 

Note, idea of using sympy in following way for 1D states came from this article: https://medium.com/math-simplified/simplify-algebra-in-quantum-mechanics-with-python-d44d4a022067.
